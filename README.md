# Unity-Fractals
Fractal generation in Unity 2017 using Jasper Flick's
[Constructing a Fractal](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/constructing-a-fractal)
tutorial from Catlike Coding.

Notes:

* In Unity 2017 the Overdraw view is on the Scene toolbar in
first dropdown on the left with the default label of Shaded.
It is no longer set to RGB, in fact there is no RGB entry in
the menu.
